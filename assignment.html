The Applied Science approach that INES has adopted requires a continuous
 interaction between theoretical learning and application 
 in the professional field. Therefore Problem Based Learning projects,
 Case-studies, Simulations and Internships are combined wi<hr>
 face to face lectures, set reading, group works ,
 practical learning in computer laboratory( practice on statistical software),
 field visits ( surveys in socio-economic activities in  surrounding areas),
 and problem solving.

  <pre style="font-family:centaur;">  My name is Ben and I come 
          from Australia.
			I am 24 years old and 
				I live in small town near 
					Sydney called Branton. I 
					don’t have a job now, but
                      normally I clean shop windows.
					   I am not married 
						 I live with my very beautiful 
						   girlfriend, Maria,
                       in a nice house in Branton. We don’t My have
                    any children – but we will have one next year.
                 My girlfriend is an actress, but she isn’t very famous. 
              She acts in a small theatre in our town. At the weekend,
           we like to go swimming in a big lake near our house.
         I normally get up at eight o’clock, but on Thursday 
       I get up at six o’clock because that is the day when 
    I go running in the park. I like living in Branton 
  is a river where I go fishing sometimes when I want 
 to relax.</pre>
 
 <p style="color:blue">Through this mix of L&T methods students develop 
 a firm understanding of the professional field of Statistics applied 
 to economy and understand what competences are required form them 
 in order to be successful on the labour market. Through the projects
 the students obtain important generic competences such as leadership,
 team work, analytical thinking, responsibility and communication and
 get insights of what it takes to motivate someone to do the right things 
 in the job.</p>
 
 
 <p style="font-family:courier">As with most technical subjects, Computer Science has its own 
 terminology. This module lays the foundations by introducing some basic terminology,
 which is then used to give an overview of what a computer, is and the elements
 from which computers are made. The student is strongly urged to establish 
 the good habit of learning the terminology as it is introduced,
 starting with this module. Computer Science is concerned with 
 the application of scientific principles to the design, 
 construction and maintenance of systems based upon the use of computers

<p style="text-align:center;">. Main memory takes the form of micro¬electronic silicon chips
 housed on an electronic circuit board. A silicon chip is a miniature electronic circuit 
 equivalent to hundreds or thousands of components etched onto a wafer of silicon crystal
 the size of a fingernail. It is housed in a plastic case just big enough to hold the 
 silicon wafer and its electrical contact pins by means of which it is plugged into 
 the circuit board.

 <p style="font-size:50px;">Software is the general term used to describe 
 all the various programs that may be used on a computer system
